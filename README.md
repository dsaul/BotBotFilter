# BotBotFilter

BotBotFilter is a straightforward TwilML application designed to verify the incoming caller ID against a carddav server. If the number is found in the carddav address book, it grants access. However, if the number is not listed, the application prompts the caller to press a randomly selected number. Only when the caller correctly inputs the prompted number will access be granted.
